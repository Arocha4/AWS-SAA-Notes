SWF - task oriented API

Simple Work flow - human interaction to complete order or collection of services to complete a work order.

Workers - interact with SWF to get task, process received task and return the result

Deciders - program that co-ordinates the tasks, i.e. - ordering, concurrency and scheduling

Workers and Deciders can run independently

TASK is only assigned ONCE and NEVER DUPLICATED (key difference from SQS where messages can be processed multiple times)

SWF Domain - think of it as a container for the work flow. you can register a domain by Console or API

Maximum workflow processing time can 1 year (equivalent seconds) - SQS is 12 hours processing time
