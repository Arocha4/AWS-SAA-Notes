SQS - message oriented API

SQS - Message can contain upto 256KB of text, billed at 64KB chunks,

Single request can have 1 to 10 messages unto maximum of 256KB payload

Even though there is one message of 256Kb its basically 4 request for billing since (4 * 64KB)

NO ORDER - SQS messages can be delivered multiple times in any order

Design - you can have 2 priority queues for priority based message one for higher and other for lower priority

EC2 instances always poll for messages from the queue (pull from the queue and not push)

Visibility timeout always start from when the application instance polled the message.

Great design - Visibility timeout expires that means there is a failure somewhere since that message was polled but not processed and hence not deleted so other some other process will poll the message again and visibility timeout starts again.

Visibility timeout by default is 30 Seconds up to 12 hour maximum (ChangeMessageVisibility) / maximum visibility

Maximum long polling timeout 20 seconds (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) â€”ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds

Messages in the Queue can be retained for up to 14 days

First 1 million request ares free, then $0.50 PER EVERY MILLION REQUESTS
