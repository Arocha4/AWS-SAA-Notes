Content Delivery Network - edge locations, reduced latency, traffic serves from the closest nodes

Edge locations - content will be cached (over 50), different from region / AZ. TTL (speed of image // media is quicker - first user suffers the performance), can be not only read only (you can write it)

Origin can be - S3, EC2, ELB, Route53 also NON AWS origin server ,

Distribution - name given to the CDN consist of collection of Edge locations

(1) Web Distribution -

(2) RTMP (media streaming / flash) Distribution - for Adobe flash files only

you can have multiple origins of a distribution

Path Pattern (*)

Restrict viewer access by signed URL or Signed Cookies

Restrict content based on geo location (whitelist and blacklist)

Create invalidate - invalidate TTL (you pay for it) like purge in Akamai

VPC - logical datacenters in AWS

Can span multiple AZ, but can’t span multiple regions, PEER VPC, but no Transitive Peering

Custom VPC has to be /16 can’t go higher then that /8 is not allowed

When you create Custom VPC it creates default security group, default network ACL and default route table., it doesn’t create default Subnet

One Subnet == one AZ, you can have security group spanning multiple AZ, ACL’s span across AZ (assign sg and ACL to two different subnets)

any CIDR block 5 reserved IPs (.0, .1, .2, .3, .255)

so for CIRD block /24: 2^8 - 5 = 256 - 5 = 251 available IP address space

when you create internet gateway, by default its detached, attach it to VPC then, only 1 IGW per VPC

When you create a VPC Default Routetable(Main Routable) is created where the default Routes are,

10.0.0.0/16 Local <— all subnets inside VPC will be able to talk to each other

Don’t touch Main route table

Create another routetable for route out to internet (0.0.0.0/0 IGW) <— route out to the internet

Last thing you associate this new route table to one of the subnet which will make it public. (you can enable auto assign public IP for the public subnet)

1 subnet can have 1 routetable

ICMP is for ping / monitor

NAT instance and NAT gateway

NAT Instance - disable source / destination check., always behind security group, must be in public subnet, must have an EIP, ,must be a route out of the private subnet to NAT

Increase the instance size if bottleneck

Change the main route table - add a route (0.0.0.0/0 NAT Instance target)

NAT Instance is a single point of failover (put it behind a ASG),

NAT gateway - released in 2016 - amazon handled

Amazon maintains it for you, no need to handle yourself. (security patches applied by AWS)

You can just create the gateway and assign EIP (put it in public subnet) (automatically assigned)

Change the main route table - add a route (0.0.0.0/0 NAT gateway target)

No need for disable source/destination check or no need to put it behind a security group - it handles it for you.

Highly available / redundancy no need for ASG.NAT gateways are little bit costly - always use it in production scale automatically up to 10Gbps
