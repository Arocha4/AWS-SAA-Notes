Security groups are statefull - any inbound rule , applies to outbound as well (Only Allow rules)

by default all inbound deny, all outbound allow

can span across AZ

ACL are stateless -

For default ACL, all inbound and outbound rules are allowed by default - associated with all subnets in VPC by default

for Custom ACL, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied by default - not associated with any subnet

1 subnet is only associated with ACL. granular rules for ACLs, numbered rules (recommended steps of 100)

rule no. 99 takes precedence over rule no. 100 (if 99 is blocked and 100 is allowed) 99 will be executed.

Can SPAN across AZ

Ephemeral port - 1024 - 65535 should be allowed to take traffic.

if you want to BLOCK IP address then must use ACL, because security group doesn’t have deny

Bastion - keep it in public subnet to allow SSH / RDP into instances into private subnets (High availability - Bation in two public subnets and also ASG - Route 53 running Health checks on those Bastion)

VPC Flowlogs: to capture all the traffic information into logs - logs everything (create IAM role and create cloud watch log group - and log stream)

VPC Cleanup: can’t delete VPC if you have active running instance or ELB is running
